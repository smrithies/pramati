- Migrating data between applications or databases
- Exporting data from databases to flat files
- Loading data massively into databases
- Data cleansing

PDI is easy to use. Every process is created with a graphical tool where you specify what to do without writing code to indicate how to do it.
PDI can be used as a standalone application, or it can be used as part of the larger Pentaho Suite.
PDI supports a vast array of input and output formats, including text files, data sheets, and commercial and free database engines. Moreover, the transformation capabilities of PDI allow you to manipulate data with very few limitations.
