### Github basics.
- Able to track the changes done in a document. Take snapshots of document at different instants.

**Basic commands**

- mkdir  <name>

- cd <name>

- git init â€“ initialize the directory as git repository

- touch <filename.extension> - to create a file inside folder.
```
Once you've added or modified files in a folder containing a git repo, git will notice that changes have been made inside the repo.
```
- Git add <filename.ext> - adding to git repository
To add a file to a commit, you first need to add it to the staging environment.

- git commit -m " "
 tell git to package them into a commit

- git checkout -b <my branch name>
automatically create a new branch and then 'check you out' on it, meaning git will move you to that branch, off of the master branch.(if you need to add additional page in the main project).

- git branch-to check status of branch

- git push origin <yourbranchname>
origin-short for remote repository.
to push changes onto a new branch on GitHub, you'll want to run . GitHub will automatically create the branch for you on the remote repository: 

- git remote add origin url

- git pull origin master

- git push origin master

- git clone url
