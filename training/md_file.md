# How to create an MD file.

## What is an Md file?
- A file with the **.MD** or .MARKDOWN file extension might be a Markdown Documentation file.  
- It's a *plain text file* that uses the *Markdown language* to describe how to convert a text document to HTML.  
- README.md is a common MD file that holds text instructions.  
- Since these MD files are just plain text documents, we can open one with any text editor, like Notepad or WordPad in Windows  
- It has been adopted by the technical writing community as a solution for writing documentation.  
- Converting them to markdown means they will render right in the browser when users navigate to each folder in the browser. Makes for greater readability.  
- Markdown is a text-to-HTML conversion tool for web writers.  
- Markdown allows you to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, then convert it to structurally valid XHTML (or HTML).  
- Used for presenting documents on the web.  
###plaintext file
- This is a file that contains zero formatting (unlike RTF files), meaning nothing is bold, italic, underlined, colored, using a special font, etc.  
- Several examples of plain text file formats include ones that end in XML, REG, BAT, PLS, M3U, M3U8, SRT, IES, AIR, STP, XSPF, DIZ, SFM, THEME, and TORRENT.
