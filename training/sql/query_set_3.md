## SET 3

**1. SQL to find the missing ids from dept**

```
SELECT  dept_id +1

**2. Manager Name, Reportee who joined first (Reportee Name - doj), Reportee who draws less sal (Reportee Name - salary) - window function**

**3. Find the list of employee records WHERE salary data is missing.With the above example, we donâ€™t have salary information FROM 2012 to 2014.
Assume, if above data is as commented, then there is no missing as there is no gap** 

TABLE - salary_history

id,name,start_date,end_date,salary

1,Aneesh,2010,2011,1000

1,Aneesh,2011,2012,1100 -- 1,Aneesh,2011,2014,1100

1,Aneesh,2014,2015,1200

1,Aneesh,2015,null,1200

```
